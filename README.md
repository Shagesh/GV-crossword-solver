# Godville Crossword Solver
This Python script is a tool for solving crosswords in the Godville game. It uses mechanicalsoup and BeautifulSoup to extract the crossword puzzle and its unknown letters from the Godville website. It then scrapes the Omnibus List from the Godville wiki to get the solutions to the crossword and fills in the remaining letters.

## Requirements
The script requires the following Python packages to be installed:

* mechanicalsoup
* BeautifulSoup
* numpy

## Usage
To use the script, simply run the godville_crossword_solver.py file. The script will prompt you to enter your Godville username and password, which it uses to log in to the website. It will then navigate to the crossword page and automatically solve the puzzle.
